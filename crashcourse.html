If you were asked to describe the stars and galaxies in the
night sky, chances are the words 'vibrant' and 'dynamic' would
not be on your list. Instead, we tend to think of the Universe 
as 'serene' and 'frozen in time'. Yet the Universe is a very 
dynamic place and it only takes suitable steps in time to 
see it come to life and change!
<P>
In my daily work I study galaxy collisions. This phenomenon
is both dramatic and fun to see unfold, but you have
to have patience. To witness a crash from start to end 
in a human life, time would have to be speeded up ten 
millionfold! Luckily there are supercomputers which can
simulate galaxy collisions, and in these we can speed up 
time as much as we want. Sit back and 
<A HREF="./crashcourse/collisions.html">browse</A> through some 
of the simulations, and witness the workings of gravity
on the grandest of scales.<BR>

<H3>Galaxy Collisions: Cannibalism</H3>
Galaxy collisions are not just fun to observe. Astronomers
have found evidence that galaxy collisions have played an 
important role in shaping the galaxies we see around us.
Most of them are likely to be the results of galaxy mergers 
in the past when the Universe was young and full of smaller 
galaxies. The large galaxies we see today are the fat cannibals 
of this past.

<P>These days, galaxy collisions are rare, and they will 
become even more exceptional in the future as galaxies 
will have fewer and fewer partners to collide with, and
move further and further away from each other as the
Univere expands. That 
being said, there is at least one collision to still look 
out for: our Milky Way galaxy is already feeling the 
gravitational pull from the Andromeda galaxy (M31), our 
closest sister galaxy in space. </P>

<H3>Impatient Astronomers</H3>
Lacking the patience to wait hundreds of millions of 
years to see galaxy collisions unfold, astronomers 
are studying galaxy mergers by finding as many colliding 
galaxies as they can and sorting them by 
<A HREF="./crashcourse/glossary.html#merger phase">merger phase</A>. 
Each collision we see is thus a 'snapshot' in time, 
and by assembling hundreds of such snapshots in the 
right order we can see the whole process.
The latter is not as easy as it sounds, since
galaxies involved in a collision do not simply collide
head-on and `stick together', but rather dance around 
and pass through each other a couple of times before 
finally merging and relaxing to a new-found shape.
See the <A HREF="./crashcourse/collisions.html">merger simulations</A> 
for how complicated it
may be to figure out the merger state of a collision 
based on individual snapshots!
<P>
In 1972, the Toomre brothers, Alar and Juri, were the 
first astronomers to piece it all together. They had
a supercomputer that allowed them to represent a galaxy
by a collection of computer particles with assigned
masses and simulate how these particles would move
as a result of gravitational attraction. They proposed
that the <A HREF="./crashcourse/glossary.html#tidal tails">tidal tails</A> 
and <A HREF="./crashcourse/glossary.html#bridges">bridges</A> 
observed toward galaxy pairs are the result
of <A HREF="./crashcourse/glossary.html#gravtitational interaction">

computations they later (1977) sorted a collection 
of known galaxy pairs in order of merger phase, 
now known as

<H3>Of starbursts and monsters</H3>

There is much more to galaxy collisions than tracking
and understanding the change of orbits of individual
stars. Gas clouds in the spiral arms feel the 
change in gravitational pull just as much as the stars 
in their vicinity. The difference is that gas clouds,
when sufficiently compressed under the right conditions,
will collapse, fragment and contract to become stars. 
A galaxy collision may hence result in a spectacular 
increase in the number of stars in the two colliding 
galaxies, a so-called `starburst'. 
<P>
Another process
contributing to a spectacular rise in 
<A HREF="./crashcourse/glossary.html#luminosity">luminosity</A>
during a galaxy collision involves monster black
holes lurking at the centers of these galaxies.
The change in gravitational pull during a galaxy
merger sends stars and gas clouds spiraling in
to the black holes, where they disappear behind
the <A HREF="./crashcourse/glossary.html#event horizon">event horizon</A> 
after surrendering their stored 
<A HREF="./crashcourse/glossary.html#gravitational energy">
gravitational energy</A> to the extremely hot 
and luminous accretion disk that feeds the 
central monster.

<P>My research focusses on the most luminous galaxy
collisions, taking place in galaxies that are
faint in visible light and bright in

images, the so-called <A HREF="./crashcourse/glossary.html#lirg">
`luminous infrared galaxies'</A>.
The progenitors of these mergers are particularly 
rich in gas clouds, which predestine them up for 
extraordinary intense starbursts in which up to
a thousand <A HREF="./crashcourse/glossary.html#solar mass">
solar masses</A> of gas per year are 
converted into stars. In comparison, the star 
forming rate in our Milky Way galaxy is at 
present just a wimpy one solar mass per year.
The majority of luminous infrared galaxies also 
host very luminous central black holes, and they 
too florish thanks to the rich supply of gas and 
stars sent their way during the merger process.</P>

<P>
Most of the star formation in a luminous infrared
galaxy takes place in the center of the galaxy 
crash, where the gas has piled up together with 
grains of silicates (sand) and carbonaceous
materials (soot or coal). These so-called
<A HREF="./crashcourse/glossary.html#dust">`dust'</A> grains 
are a normal <1% component of gas clouds and play
a central role in star and planet formation. 

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="./crashcourse/SiC_stardust_grain.rhonda_stroud.gif">
</CENTER>

<P>
They are, however, also a nuisance, as they absorb 
(block) light coming from behind them, making it
difficult for astronomers to see what exactly is
going on at the center of a galaxy crash and find
answers to important questions like:
<ul>
<li>Is a starburst producing most of the light 
or a supermassive central black hole?</li>
<li>How does this change as the collision proceeds? 
Does the starburst dominate the first phase of the 
crash and the <A HREF="./crashcourse/glossary.html#accretion">
accreting</A> supermassive central black hole 
the latter?</li>
</ul>

<P>Luckily, light has the property that it can
avoid getting absorbed by dust grains if the 
wavelength of the light waves are long enough.
A gas and dust cloud <A HREF="./crashcourse/absorption.html#opaque">
completely opaque in visible light</A> may 
hence be <A HREF="./crashcourse/absorption.html#transparant">
transparent</A> in infrared light, which has 
2 to 200 times longer wavelengths!
I use this fortunate property of infrared
light to see deeper into the gas and 
dust-enshrouded hearts of colliding galaxies 
to study their supermassive central black holes 
and starbursts, and help finding answers to 
the questions above.





<H3>Infrared light: revealing the cool Universe</H3>
More transparency is not the only advantage of 
observing in infrared light. Every type of astronomical
research benefits from comparing observations of
the same object at different wavelengths; just like 
one is better informed about world affairs from 
gathering news from around the globe than from 
only reading the local newspaper.
While visible light observations are especially
suited to detecting light from stars, infrared
light observations are particularly sensitive
to detecting the 
<A HREF="./crashcourse/glossary.html#glow">glow</A> from dust 
grains that are 
mixed in with gas clouds. This makes infrared
and visible light observations quite complementary:
one tells us where the current generation of 
stars is, the other shows us where the gas clouds 
are out of which new stars may be or are being
assembled!






<H3>Observing the Universe in infrared light is challenging</H3>
Observing the Universe in infrared light may be 
very useful, but it is technically very challenging.
Earth's atmosphere is very bright in infrared 
light, even at night. This makes it difficult
to see the extraterrestrial sources of infrared 
light amidst the foreground glow of the sky,
similar to trying to do some stargazing at high
noon. Another problem facing infrared observers
is that the gasses in Earth's atmosphere block 
the light coming in from outer space, except 
for a few infrared 'windows' (narrow wavelength
ranges) in which the atmospheric gasses are less 
greedy and allow us some transparency. It is 
in these windows that most infrared observations
are performed, mostly from mountain peaks in
dry regions on the planet, where there is less
atmosphere above us and more atmospheric stability.

The Earth's atmosphere is very good at blocking 
light from outer space coming down to the surface.
As a result, from Earth we can see outer space
only at very specific wavelength ranges, called 
'windows'. Visible light falls within such a window,
as do a few infrared wavelength ranges.

</FONT></TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>

<P>
Of course, by limiting 
ourselves to using these infrared windows, the 
vast majority of the infrared wavelength range 
remains unstudied, which means that a lot of 
valuable information out there cannot be accessed. 
A costly but very effective way around this is
to send up infrared telescopes into space and
study the infrared universe from there! This
also solves the problem of observing through
a glowing infrared sky. The first infrared 
space observatory, 
<A HREF="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/IRASdocs/iras.html">
IRAS</A>, was launched 
25 years ago and surveyed the infrared heavens 
at four different infrared colors. The mission
was a huge success and resulted in lots of 
discoveries. One of these discoveries was a 
type of galaxy that is extremely bright in 
infrared light but hardly visible in visible
light: the <A HREF="./crashcourse/glossary.html#ulirg">
`ultra-luminous infrared galaxies'</A>
(ULIRGs), the champions among the class of
colliding galaxies and the focus of my research.






<H3>Infrared imaging of luminous infrared galaxies from space</H3>
Performing infrared observations from space also
has some disadvantages. The telescope needs to
be kept cold to be able to detect the infrared
light from objects that are warmer than the 
telescope itself. Otherwise the infrared glow 
from the mirror and the telescope tube would 
outshine the light from the distant objects 
we are trying to study. Cooling requires embedding
the telescope in a gigantic freezer and keeping
the freezer cool by evaporating little bits of 
liquid helium at a temperature close to 4 Kelvin 
(-450 degrees F; - 269 degrees C). Since the 
costs of launching a satellite are determined 
by its weight, none of the infrared space telescopes 
launched so far 
(<A HREF="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/IRASdocs/iras.html">IRAS</A> in 1982, 
<A HREF="http://sci.esa.int/iso">ISO</A> in 1995 and 
<A HREF="http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/">SST</A> in 2003) 
are very big. And since the diameter 
of a telescope mirror determines how sharp it can 
see, none of the infrared space observatories 
launched so far has been able to deliver very 
sharp images.

<P>
The sharpness of an image is also determined 
by the color in which the image is taken. An 
image taken in visible light is 10 times sharper 
than an image taken at 10 times longer infrared 
wavelengths. This 
explains why visible-light images taken by 
the Hubble Space Telescope are so much sharper
than from any of the infrared space telescopes.
Not only is the mirror of the Hubble Space 
Telescope 3 times larger in diameter, it also
observes at 2-800 times shorter wavelengths
than the latest infrared space telescope: a 
difference in sharpness of a factor 6-2400! 
<A HREF="./crashcourse/sharpness.html">Compare</A> the images 
of the `Antennae' colliding 
galaxies obtained by the Hubble Space Telescope 
and the infrared Spitzer Space Telescope and
see the striking difference in sharpness.
<P>
The next space telescope with mid-infrared 
observing capabilities, 
<A HREF="http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/">JWST</A>, 
to be launched in 2018, will have a mirror 
with a diameter nearly 8 times larger than
that of the current infrared space telescope.
This will provide 8 times more detail to 
mid-infrared images of distant ultra-luminous 
infrared galaxies, which currently look like dots 
and don't tell us anything more than where they are.

<H3>The power of infrared spectroscopy</H3>
The lack of sharpness of images produced by infrared 
space observatories is more than compensated for by 
the wealth of new insights gained by using these space 
telescopes in another way: by separating light in
the colors it is composed of, and studying the 
color-to-color (wavelength by wavelength) brightness 
variations. This technique, called spectroscopy, can 
be used for any sort of light: visible light, infrared 
light, UV light, and produces what astronomers 
refer to as a `spectrum'.
<P>
If you would apply this technique on ordinary sunlight,
this would reveal a rainbow band of colors stretching 
from deep violet (the shortest visible wavelength) to 
deep red (the longest visible wavelength) which, when 
combined back together, conspire to give the Sun its 
white appearance.

<P>Taking a closer look at the spectrum of the Sun, 
you can see that some very specific colors are clearly
dimmer than others and that there are thousands of
dim regions throughout the solar spectrum. These are 
the `fingerprints' of different atomic elements that 
make up the composition of the Sun! Each atomic element
can be identified by its specific set of wavelengths
at which it makes its mark, and these fingerprints
are the same throughout the Universe!</P>

<P>Taking a spectrum in infrared light serves the same 
purpose: obtaining the fingerprints of atoms and 
molecules that leave their marks at specific infrared 
colors. Based on these fingerprints, astronomers 
compute the physical conditions in the object the 
telescope is pointed at and infer how these conditions 
may have come about.
For instance, in an infrared spectrum we can see 
whether dust grains in gas clouds are coated with 
a thin layer of water ice by looking for the finger
prints of water ice at infrared wavelengths of 3.0 
and 6.0 micrometers (6 and 12 times longer wavelengths
than green light). If present, the gas cloud must 
be cold, because water ice cannot exist in warm 
environments. This then means that there cannot be
a star very close-by, because it would warm up the 
gas cloud and melt the ice coating on the dust 
grains.</P>

<P>Below I will show what we have learned about galaxy 
collisions from the analysis of infrared spectra of 
luminous infrared galaxies. I will start by showing 
how different the infrared spectra of luminous infrared 
galaxies can be and what these differences tell us 
about the power sources responsible for their huge 
luminosity.</P>

spectrum whether the galaxy you are looking at
is undergoing a starburst (turning gas clouds 
into new stars) is by looking for the
spectroscopic fingerprints of a toxic substance 
called 'polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons' 
<A HREF="http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/features/articles/20050627.shtml">
(PAHs)</A>.

<P>
On Earth you can find PAHs in the fumes
of car exhausts, in mothballs, and in badly 
burned hamburgers. In space, PAH molecules are a 
normal component of gas clouds (along with dust 
grains, water molecules and many other species). 
When hit by UV or visible light from a nearby 
massive star a PAH molecule will start 
vibrating to shake off the energy it was forced 
to absorb. The vibration results in the emission
of light at several characteristic infrared 
wavelengths. Infrared spectrographs can detect 
this pattern and recognize them as the infrared 
fingerprints of PAHs!

<P>Star forming
gas clouds can thus be recognized by looking
for the presence of fingerprints of PAHs in
the infrared spectrum of such a cloud. This is 
why we know, for instance, that the distant
ultraluminous infrared galaxy IRAS 14060+2919 
(700 times more distant than the Andromeda
galaxy) must be undergoing an intense starburst.
The stars first born within the contracting
gas clouds are illuminating their birth cloud, 
force the PAH molecules to vibrate and shake
off the excess energy in the form of infrared 
light.</P>

<P>
From the detection of PAH fingerprints in the
spectrum of IRAS 14060+2919 we estimate that
this galaxy is turning gas clouds into stars
at a rate of 400 solar masses per year! 400
times faster than in our peaceful galaxy, and
all as the result of a collision with another 
galaxy.
<P>
PAH fingerprints are also found all over
the <A HREF="./crashcourse/crashsnapshots.html#antennae">
Antennae galaxies</A>, indicating that they 
too derive their huge luminosity from a 
collision-triggered starburst.






<H3>Luminous infrared galaxies possessed
by supermassive black holes</H3>

If a luminous infrared galaxy derives most
of its luminosity from a supermassive black 
hole at its center, then this does not go 
unnoticed at infrared wavelengths! Although
the black hole itself does not produce any
light -- by definition -- the region around
it, called the `accretion disk', produces 
a lot of light because of the enormous amounts 
of energy dumped into this region by stars and 
gas clouds that are forced to spiral down to 
the center. Most of this light is UV and X-ray 
light, which have very destructive powers!
It can strip atoms of several of their orbiting 
electrons, or rip apart molecules. This is 
why it is not a good idea to expose yourself 
to UV light from the Sun, or to have many X-rays 
taken at your doctor's office. In space, one of 
the ways to recognize a feeding black hole is to
look for atoms stripped of several of their 
orbiting electrons. Some of these atoms, or
`ions' as we call them when they have lost
some electrons, send out light at very specific
infrared wavelengths. For instance, Neon atoms, 
stripped of 4 of their electrons, send out 
light at 14.3 micrometers (a 29 times longer 
wavelength than green light). Neon atoms 
stripped of another electron do the same at 
7.6 micrometers.
Also, other kinds of atoms (Argon and Oxygen)
have fingerprints in the infrared that 
indicate that these atoms have been stripped
of electrons. An infrared spectrograph 
pointed at a supermassive black hole 
can detect these fingerprints and warn
us of the presence of the lurking monster.

In a luminous infrared galaxy, a supermassive
central black hole attracts so much gas that
the black hole cannot possibly swallow all
the gas at once. The gas piles up in a doughnut 
shaped structure centered on the black hole and
its oribiting accretion disk. Astronomers call
this structure a torus. Because of its proximity
to the accretion disk, the gas and dust in the 
torus is intensely illuminated by the harsh 
X-ray and UV light from the accretion disk. As 
a result, the torus warms up and dust grains 
within it can get really warm: anywhere from
150 to 1000 Kelvin (-200 to +1400 degrees F; 
-100 to +700 degrees C). At these temperatures
dust grains glow brightly at infrared wavelengths,
especially between 3 and 12 micrometers (6 to 24 
times longer wavelength than green light). The warm
glow can be seen with infrared spectrographs
and serves as another way to identify feeding
supermassive central black holes.

The pair of colliding galaxies named Markarian 463 
(galaxy number 463 in the catalogue of the Armenian 
astronomer Markarian; 300 times more distant than
the Andromeda galaxy) is a typical case of a luminous
infrared galaxy dominated by a central black hole;
or two in this case, one in each of the merging
galaxies! The infrared spectrum of this merger
looks quite different from that of IRAS 14060+2919
(the starburst-dominated galaxy).
PAH emission bands are absent, indicating that this
galaxy is not powered by a starburst. Instead we
see fingerprints of Neon atoms stripped of 4 or 5 
electrons: the sign posts of a feeding black hole!

<H3>Deeply enshrouded luminous infrared galaxies</H3>
A third distinct group of luminous infrared galaxies 
is the most mysterious class. Their infrared spectra 
are dominated by a very pronounced fingerprint of 
silicates (sand) centered at a wavelength of 10
micrometers (a wavelength 20 times longer than green
light). At the same time, fingerprints of 
PAH molecules are largely absent, indicating no clear 
signs for an ongoing starburst. Also fingerprints 
of heavily mutilated Neon atoms --stripped of 4 to 
5 of their electrons -- are absent. Hence, no clear 
sign of a feeding supermassive black hole either. 
And yet an enormous luminosity is protruding from 
the nuclei of these galaxies.....
<P>
The pronounced silicate feature holds the key to 
unlocking part of the mystery. Silicates are one of the 
two main materials from which dust grains are assembled.
So, when we find a silicate feature in a spectrum, 
we know we that we are looking at dust grains. And,
as we discussed before, where there are dust grains 
there are gas clouds.
The strength of the silicate feature hence indicates 
that the power sources of these galaxies are hidden
behind a very thick layer of gas clouds.
The thickness of this layer is so great that we 
cannot see through, even in the infrared. This 
explains why we don't find fingerprints of a
starburst or of a feeding supermassive black hole
in spectra of this kind of luminous infrared galaxies:
their fingerprints are obscured!

<P>
A good example of a deeply enshrouded luminous infrared 
galaxy is NGC4418, a relatively nearby galaxy (40 times 
more distant than the Andromeda galaxy). Images 
show the galaxy to lack a spiral structure and nearly
all its luminosity to originate in a tiny point-like
nucleus. The infrared spectrum of NGC4418 is markedly 
different from that of the starbursting galaxy IRAS 
14060+2919 and the black hole-dominated galaxy Mrk463. 
Besides a deep silicate feature, the spectrum shows 
other pronounced features that are not present in the
spectra of the other two galaxies. These finger
prints may hold clues to what is going on within
the deeply obscured region!

<P>
One such fingerprint is found at a wavelength of 
6 micrometers and indicates the presence of huge 
amounts of water ice. From other studies we know
that water ice freezes out on dust grains when gas
clouds are cold enough. For NGC4418 this means that
the gas clouds that obscure its tiny power house must 
be very cold.
<P>
Another set of fingerprints, at wavelengths around 
14 micrometers, indicates that some of the obscuring
clouds must be very dense and may be forming new stars
inside! 
The latter we infer from comparing to studies of star 
forming regions in our own galaxy, where the 
fingerprints of acetelyne (C2H2) at 13.7 micrometers 
and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) at 14.0 micrometers appear 
in the infrared spectra of dense gas shells around 
'stars-under-construction', the so-called 'proto stars'.

<P>
Another indication that infrared spectra like those
of NGC4418 may be indicating hidden star formation
is the presence of fingerprints of crystalline 
silicates (crushed glass) at several wavelengths in the
infrared spectrum. In our galaxy we see these finger
prints in the infrared spectra of debris disks around
newly formed stars, where the intense radiation from
the new-born star heats up dust grains in the disk
and forges the silicates into glass-like substances,
one of which is a well-known mineral known as 
Forsterite.

</TABLE>
</CENTER>

<P>Crystalline silicates are also forged
in the `stellar winds' (breath) of aging massive 
stars and are blown away along with other stellar 
debris. Other observations in our galaxy tell us that 
crystalline silicates are easily destroyed in the 
harsh climate between stars, the `interstellar medium': 
fingerprints of crystalline silicates are not found 
in any other environments than the places where we 
know crystalline silicates are being formed. And yet, 
deeply enshrouded luminous infrared galaxies like 
NGC4418 show them to be a prominent component of the 
gas clouds that obscure their nuclei -- exactly the
kind of environment where we would have expected 
crystalline silicates to have been destroyed! The
detection of their fingerprints in gas clouds in
NGC4418 must hence mean that crystalline silicates 
are being replenished faster than that they are 
being destroyed, and that the furnaces where they are 
formed are likely close-by. My best bet: a starburst
behind the clouds!</P>

<P>
In 2006, the discovery of crystalline silicates in 
ULIRGs by a group of astronomers led by me resulted 
in a NASA press release. The story, 
graphics and a podcast interview with me can be found

<H3>fingerprinting other luminous infrared galaxies</H3>
Armed with a good understanding of how to interpret 
the fingerprints of PAHs, stripped-down Neon atoms,
hot dust, deep silicate features, water ice, hydrogen 
cyanide and crystalline silicates, we can now move 
toward fingerprinting other luminous infrared galaxies 
besides IRAS 14060+2919, Mrk463 and NGC4418. This will 
tell us to what extent colliding galaxies are dominated
by a starburst, a feeding supermassive black hole or
by strong obscuration around an enshrouded power source.

</CENTER>

<P>
Most of the other luminous infrared galaxies that 
we fingerprinted seem to line up along two branches.
One that diagonally connects NGC4418 and IRAS 14060+2919, 
and another that horizontally connects Mrk463 and 
IRAS 14060+2919. Galaxies on these branches have
properties in common with both galaxies at its extremes. 
For instance, a galaxy half way along the horizontal 
branch has a feeding supermassive black hole at its center 
and a starburst around it,a galaxy half way along the 
diagonal branch has both an enshrouded nucleus and
a starburst around it.</P>

<P>As you can see, most of the luminous infrared galaxies
that we fingerprinted seem to be starburst dominated,
with little to moderate obscuration in the nucleus.
There are also quite a few that thank their luminosity
largely to a feeding supermassive black hole. And then 
there is the mysterious class of luminous infrared 
galaxies that look most like NGC4418. Their strong 
obscuration cannot last forever. The gas clouds piled 
up around the nucleus eventually will turn into stars 
or will be dispersed by the power source hiding behind 
them. Some of my colleagues think that this power source 
is a feeding black hole. I, myself, think that this is 
a serious possibility, but there is no clear evidence 
yet (fingerprints!) to prove it. If they indeed are 
deeply buried supermassive black holes, they will 
eventually transform into sources like Mrk463 and 
should migrate downward in the diagram toward Mrk463. 
As you can see, there are a few galaxies in this 
transition region (labeled class "2A" in the diagram). 
These luminous infrared galaxies may be on their way. 
Of course we could wait a few 100 million years to see 
whether these sources have transformed themselves and 
have moved in my diagram. Astronomers do not want to 
wait this long. We will create more sophisticated galaxy 
crash simulations, launch more powerful space observatories 
and gather more spectra to study galaxy fingerprints 
across all wavelengths and solve this mystery before 
any galaxy has moved an inch.

<P>In parallel with our detailed spectroscopic studies

detectors capable of registering their faint,

only the most luminous infrared galaxies out there are 
within detection range, but their spectra come through 
clearly enough to identify their thickest fingerprints: 
those of PAHs, silicates and glowing dust grains. This 
allows us to classify these sources in the same way as 
for `local' luminous infrared galaxies: 
as starburst-dominated, black hole-dominated or 
enshrouded. Other fingerprints, like those of water 
ice, crystalline silicates, stripped Neon atoms, or 
hydrogen cyanide -- to name a few -- are too weak to

<H3>Future work</H3>

<P>The infrared spectra of luminous infrared galaxies
obtained by the Spitzer Space Telescope and its
predecessor ISO have greatly increased our understanding 
of the coexistence of starbursts and supermassive black 
holes in the hearts of colliding galaxies. But in some
cases the amount of debris piled up in the collision
is too much to stay <A HREF="./crashcourse/absorption.html#transparant">
transparent</A> in the infrared.
We already saw this in the nucleus of NGC4418, where
neither the fingerprints of a feeding supermassive black
hole nor those of a starburst managed to register in
the spectrum. There we turned to secondary fingerprints,
like crystalline silicates and hydrogen cyanide to give
us hints of what power sources reside under the thick
blankets that cover the nucleus.</P>

<P>There are, however, other wavelengths that may help
us to find an answer to our remaining questions. In May
2009, the European Space Agency launched another infrared
telescope, <A HREF="http://herschel.cf.ac.uk/">the Herschel 
Space Observatory</A>. This telescope, the largest 
observatory in space so far, will study the infrared
sky at wavelengths up to 200 times longer than the Spitzer
Space Telescope. At these wavelengths dust grains in gas 
clouds are even less opaque, allowing us to look deeper 
into the power houses of colliding galaxies.

<A NAME="ALMA"></A>
And then there is an eagerly awaited groundbased 
observatory, 
<A HREF="http://www.almaobservatory.org/">ALMA</A>, 
located at an altitude of more than 5000 meters 
<A HREF="http://www.almaobservatory.org/images/stories/videos/large/almaanimation2010b.mpg">on the Chilean altiplano</A>, to be
as close to space as possible. This facility will
allow us to obtain spectra at wavelengths 2000 times 
longer than visible light (100 times longer than
mid-infrared light) and study the fingerprints
of both simple (carbon monoxide: CO) and complex 
molecules that reside in the gas clouds in colliding 
galaxies. Since the 
chemical composition of a gas cloud is affected by the
radiation of a starburst or a feeding supermassive
black hole, we expect to find differences in the
strengths of molecular fingerprints between 
completely enshrouded starbursts and completely
enshrouded supermassive black holes. If not Herschel,
then perhaps ALMA will uncover the secrets of the
most deeply obscured colliding galaxies.
