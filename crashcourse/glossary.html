<P>
<A name="accretion"><B>Accretion:</B></A>
An object with a large mass has a large gravitational pull
on matter in its vicinity. Using this ability, a supermassive 
black hole is able to swallow a lot of nearby matter. The
latter process is refered to as accretion.


<P>
<A name="bridges"><B>Bridges:</B></A>
A band or rather, stream, of stars connecting the nuclei 
of the two interacting galaxies. A good example of a bridge
can be seen in the image of the pair of interacting galaxies
known as <A HREF="./crashsnapshots.html#The Mice">`The Mice'</A>.


<P>
<A name="diluted"><B>Diluted infrared light:</B></A>
The brightness of a bulb, star or galaxy falls of with the square of
the distance, because the light gets spread out (is diluted) over a 
larger and larger area around the source. Hence the brightness
decreases by a factor 4 by doubling and a factor 9 by tripling the 
distance.


<P>
<A name="dust"><B>Dust:</B></A>
What do astronomers know about dust? Do they ever vacuum? 
In astronomy `dust' is a term used for tiny particles composed
of silicates (sand) and carbonaceous substances (soot or coal)
that are a less than 1% component of gas clouds. Despite their
small numbers, dust is very effective at blocking light from 
objects behind it. A good example is the dark cloud 
<A HREF="./absorption.html#opaque">`Barnard 68'</A>.


<P>
<A name="event horizon"><B>Event horizon:</B></A>
A black hole is black because light trying to escape
does not have a high enough velocity to actually escape
the gravtitational pull of the black hole. The event
horizon is the distance from the center of the black
hole at which the gravitational pull of the black hole
has dropped to a level that light that is produced there 
can escape. The event horizon is clearly visible in
<A HREF="../crashcourse.html#event horizon">this</A> 
artist impression of a black hole and accretion disk.


<P>
<A name="feature"><B>Feature:</B></A>
In this context, another word for a distinct wobble in a 
spectrum that we indentify as a finger print of a chemical 
substance. PAH molecules have strong PAH features in the 
infrared spectrum, which serve as their finger prints. 
Also silicates (sand) can be recognized by their strong 
features in infrared spectra.

<P>
<A name="glow"><B>Glow from dust grains:</B></A>
Warm dust grains give of a glow, just like a camp fire
or an infrared heater do. The perceived glow actually
is infrared light which we would see if our eyes would
be sensitive to infrared light.

<P>
<A name="gravitational energy"><B>Gravitational energy:</B></A>
You know you've got gravitational energy in you when you jump 
off a diving board and fall into the pool without any effort! 
During the free fall, stored gravitational energy is released 
and turned into 'kinetic' energy (speed energy). Upon impact on
the water the kinetic energy is used to create a splash, waves 
and short-lived currents. Were Earth's gravitational pull twice 
as low, you would have only half the gravitational energy to play 
with. If you replace yourself by a star and Earth by a 
supermassive black hole, you have got a lot of gravitational 
energy to loose by spiraling down into the black hole!

<P>
<A name="gravitational interaction"><B>Gravitational interaction:</B></A>
Any object with mass exerts an attracting force on another 
object with mass. Without this force galaxies would fly by
each other rather than interact (change course) and merge.
Gravitational interaction between Earth and you keeps your 
feet firmly on the ground and the Earth in orbit around the
Sun.


<P>
<A name="infrared"><B>Infrared light:</B></A>
A color of light redder than the human eye can see. Infrared light
has wavelengths that are at least twice as long as green light.
Besides visible light and infrared light there are many more
types of light. These differ from each other by their wavelength.
Click <A HREF="./emspectrum.jpg">here</A> for a nice
graphic overview of existing colors and note what a tiny fraction
of colors we call visible light!


<P>
<A name="lightyear"><B>Lightyear:</B></A>
The distance traveled by light over the period of a year.
Given the speed of light (299 792.458  km/s or 186 282.397 miles/s)
this amounts to 9 460 730 472 580.8 km or 5 878 625 373 183.61 miles.



<P>
<A name="lirg"><B>LIRG:</B></A>
Luminous InfraRed Galaxy. These galaxies produce at least
a hundred billion times the power of our Sun in infrared light.
Most of them are colliding galaxies.

<P>
<A name="luminosity"><B>Luminosity:</B></A>
Light power emitted by an object. The luminosity of 
a 75 Watt light bulb is 75 Watt, that of the Sun is 
385 000000 000000 000000 000000 Watt!
Luminosity should not be confused with brightness. The latter 
decreases with distance, the former is a property of the bulb,
star or galaxy which does not change. A 75 Watt bulb is still
a 75 Watt bulb even if it is a mile away.



<P>
<A name="merger phase"><B>Merger phase:</B></A>
Other word
for stage of collision. This assumes that as a result of
a galaxy collisions the two galaxies merge to become one
bigger galaxy. Alternatively, under the right conditions,
the galaxies may part ways again.


<P>
<A name="silicates"><B>Solar mass:</B></A>
A solar mass is the amount of mass contained in the Sun.
Astronomers rather express the mass of an astronomical 
object in solar masses than in kilograms or tons. 
One solar mass amounts to 
2 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 kg. That's why.


<P>
<A name="soot"><B>Soot:</B></A>
particles found in smoke and flames, based on carbon.
The yellow/orange color of flames in a wood fire or candle
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flame">flame</A>
is caused by particles of soot set aglow by the burning fire.


<P>
<A name="tidal tails"><B>Tidal tails:</B></A>
Long filaments of stars and gas clouds ejected from 
colliding galaxies in the collision process. The most
famous tidal tails give 
<A HREF="./crashsnapshots.html#antennae">`the Antennae'</A> 
galaxies their name.


<P>
<A name="ulirg"><B>ULIRG:</B></A>
Ultra-Luminous InfraRed Galaxy. These galaxies produce 
at least a thousand billion times the power of our Sun in 
infrared light. Nearly all of them are colliding galaxies.
